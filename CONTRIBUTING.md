## How to contribute

If this is your first open source contribution please read this https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6

There are two ways to contribute here,

* If you see a service missing, then add it the list
* If you find a mistake, correct it.

### Add a new service to the list or make changes.

1. Create a fork and clone it. Again you can follow this: https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6

2. Add a new service to its appropriate group in [Services list](https://github.com/sksaifuddin/aws-resources-specification/blob/main/README.md). Note: There is no official group for services, you can just add service to the group which logically make sense according to you.

3. Update the table of content

4. Create the PR.

Alternatively, If you are lazy enough to not create a PR ðŸ¥² but you see some mistake or a service missing, you can just an issue with description and service name.
